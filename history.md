### I discover the wonders of home computers

I had my introduction to home computers in 1981 when a friend got a ZX81, despite the simple hardware I was hooked and remember spending many hours typing in magazine listings and marvelling at the amazing games they resulted in.

Later on (probably 1982) another friend whose mum was a teacher was lucky enough to get a BBC Micro and this opened up a new world of possibilities and amazing games. I loved Defender in the arcades so Acornsofts Planetoid was a particular favourite of mine. My friend with the ZX81 migrated to a Dragon 32 and then a TI99-4A before finally switching to a BBC so I had a lot of exposure to different machines and was gradually learning more about programing.

Another source of knowledge was our local computer club which ran every Friday evening in the local village hall, this provided access to a wide variety of hardware including a home built Nascom in a wooden box and incredibly knowledgeable owners who were keen to pass on that knowledge.

Thanks to my friends with their various computers and the knowledge I gained from attending the computer club, by the time I started my O-Level in computer studied I already had a head start - knowing more about a subject than the teacher was a new experience!

Our school computer room (really a Maths room) had a bank of BBC micros along one wall, if we were lucky the teachers would allow us to load games on them at lunch time. If we were *really* lucky (and doing well in our studies) then we were allowed to take BBCs home with us during the holidays. This was great fun - but also the reason why I failed my mock O-Levels, I was meant to be revising but the wonders of disc Elite meant that I spent a large amount of time exploring far away galaxies instead.

Having access to all these computers was great, but I wanted my own. Funds were limited though, I could only afford what I saved from a paper round and money I was given for birthdays and at Christmas. The BBC was out of reach, but luckily Acorn announced the Electron and I was able to buy one soon after they became available.

Having my own computer in my bedroom (plugged in to a tiny 14" black and white TV) allowed me to develop my programing (and games playing) skills and I spent many happy hours typing in listings from the "Electron User" magazine and trying to understand how games could be created. I started learning 6502 assembler as this was the "language of game creation" but I was never able to create anything more than simple demos. In hindsight, I was more of a "consumer" back then - there were so many games that I enjoyed playing and creating my own game seemed a pipe dream.

In time, I added a Plus 3 floppy disk drive to my Electron and in order to play my favourite games I had to learn how to decode them and get them running from disk given the reduced memory available. This provided me with some valuable skills in 6502 coding and the ability to disassemble the games that I was trying to convert.

I did want to write my own games and started work on many different projects, none of which ever came to much. One idea in particular involved the player flying a helicopter in a vertically scrolling environment shooting enemies but I didn't get much further than creating some helicopter graphics, the technicalities of creating a smooth scrolling game environment were beyond me so my helicopter game seemed like something that would never happen.

### The 16 bit era

Eventually (and sadly) I outgrew the Electron, by 1987 16 bit computers had arrived and the step up these machines provided over the humble 8 bit micros was hard to resist. The same friend who introduced me to computers with the ZX81 was now the proud owner of an Amiga 1000. The capabilities of the Amiga were astonishing to someone used to simple 8 colour games with limited sounds and I was hooked.

This also coincided with me starting my first job as an apprentice software engineer, I had decided that I didn't want to go to university after 6th form and I was very lucky to have accesss to an engieering apprenticeship at a local company. Having a job (although not hugely well paid as an apprentice) meant that I was able to buy an Amiga 500, my Electron (and everything that went with it) was sold to a friend of my brother to help fund the Amiga purchase.

With the Amiga, I also bought a Philips colour monitor so that I was able to experience its graphical capabilities in full which was nice after having spent so long with just black & white colours. As part of my apprenticeship I was undertaking an HNC in software engineering and was learning a new (to me) programing language called C, luckily I had access to Lattice C on my Amiga so was able to accelerate my exploration of its capabilities at the same time as studying for my HNC. I was also lucky in that my work involved Motorola 68020 processors, so I was able to write 68k at both home and work! Various Amiga hardware reference manuals were purchased allowing me to start exploring the wonderful custom hardware that the Amiga supported and soon I (with a group of friends) was coding Amiga demos.
