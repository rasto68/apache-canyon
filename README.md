**Instructions**

Fly your Apache gunship helicopter up the canyon destroying the invading aliens.

Your auto-pilot will stop you from hitting the canyon walls, but you can still crash into the enemy so be careful!

You may find your path blocked by an enemy force-field, you will need to destroy each of the force-field towers in order to continue.

You have an un-limited supply of "laser bullets" using technology captured from the aliens and your gunship also has a shield that provides limited protection from alien projectiles or ships crashing into you. It won't provide any protection from the force field though so be sure to stop before you hit it!

Your fuel, shields and missiles will run down as you progress - you will be able to re-supply each of these. Fuel re-supplies appear when you have travelled up the valley so keep moving! Shield and missile re-supplies will appear when your shield and missiles run low but only if you have destroyed enough enemies first - nothing is free in life.

You will be awarded an extra gunship each time you score 10000 points.

The first alien waves are relatively easy to destroy, but as you travel further up the canyon your enemies will be harder to destroy and will also be more lethal - how long can you last?

Intelligence reports suggest that a "super" alien has been spotted further down the canyon, details are sketchy so watch out!
