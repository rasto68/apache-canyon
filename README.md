**Instructions**

Fly your Apache gunship helicopter up the canyon destroying the invading aliens, your auto-pilot will stop you from hitting the canyon walls. Your gunship is armed with an unlimited supply of "lazer bullets" and a limited number of "homing missiles" - both of these use technology captured from the invaders and they are able to penetrate the enemies shields to allow them to be destroyed. Your gunship also benefits from a shield that uses similar alien technology, this provides limited protection from alien projectiles or ships crashing into you.

Your fuel, shields and missiles will run down as you progress but you will be able to re-supply each of these. Fuel re-supplies appear at regular intervals up the canyon, so keep moving before you run out! Shield and missile re-supplies will appear when your shield and missiles run low but only if you have destroyed enough enemies first - nothing is free in life.

You will be awarded an extra gunship each time you score 10000 points.

You may occasionally find your path blocked by an enemy force-field, you will need to destroy each of the force-field towers using your "lazer bullets" in order to continue. The force-field will unfortunately block any bullets or missiles you try to fire through it and your missiles cannot track the towers.

The first alien waves are relatively easy to destroy, but as you travel further up the canyon your enemies will be harder to destroy and will also be more lethal - how long can you last?

Intelligence reports suggest that a "super" alien has been spotted further down the canyon, details are sketchy so watch out!
